# First-school-project
Its a beginner school project I modified a bit.

Firstly the program asks user to choose how many games they want to play. Then it generates a random number between 1 and 100 and user has to guess it. Every try user gets the message if the randomly generated value is smaller or larger. At the end the program returns the number of guesses (not including strings and below 0 and above 100 answers) and number of played games.
